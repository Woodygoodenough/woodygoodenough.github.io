### Project Overview

This project implements a fully automated financial data analytics workflow, covering API-based data ingestion, ETL pipeline design, feature engineering, aggregation, and analytics-ready data publishing. The system is designed for reproducibility, modularity, and downstream consumption by multiple visualization tools.

Processed datasets are published on a schedule and consumed by interactive dashboards, enabling rapid iteration, exploratory analysis, and comparative visualization across different front-end frameworks.

### Interactive Demo (Streamlit)

The embedded dashboard below demonstrates real-time consumption of periodically published analytics data, supporting exploratory inspection, filtering, and summary visualization.
